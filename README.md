# **[WIP]** A Study on the Effect of Home Performance Improvement Program on Energy and Cost Savings in the State of New York

## Overview
The Residential Existing Homes Program is a market transformation program that uses Building Performance Institute (BPI) Goldstar contractors to install comprehensive energy-efficient improvements.  The program is designed to use building science and a whole-house approach to reduce energy use in the Stateâ€™s existing one-to-four family and low-rise multifamily residential buildings and capture heating fuel and electricity-related savings.  The Program provides income-based incentives, including an assisted subsidy for households with income up to 80% of the State or Median County Income, whichever is higher to install eligible energy efficiency improvements including building shell measures, high efficiency heating and cooling measures, ENERGY STAR appliances and lighting.

## Business Objective:
Eligible measures include building shell measures, such as air sealing and insulation; appliances, such as energy efficient refrigerators; heating measures, such as boilers and furnaces; cooling measures, such as energy efficient room or central air conditioners, and certain renewable energy technologies. The purpose of this impact evaluation of the program is to establish first year energy savings for Home Performance Improvement projects completed in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. The objective is to identify if the measures taken by the program have been successful in reducing the overall economic costs and reducing energy needs depending upon the performance after the end of the first year after measure implementation.

### Data Description: https://data.ny.gov/Energy-Environment/Residential-Existing-Homes-One-to-Four-Units-Energ/4a2x-yp8g

## Data Assessment:
- Estimated Annual kWh Savings, Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings, and First Year Energy Savings $ Estimate represent contractor reported savings derived from energy modelling software calculations and not actual realized energy savings.

-	The accuracy of the Estimated Annual kWh Savings and Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings for projects has been evaluated by an independent third party. The results of the impact analysis indicate that, on average, actual savings amount to 35 percent of the Estimated Annual kWh Savings and 65 percent of the Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings.

## Project Statement

The project tries to identify the different means by which home owners and contractors in the state of New York are incentivized to use and provide energy efficient methods through the program administered by the NYSERDA. The purpose of the project is to create a clear picture of how to develop cost effective solutions and methods to incentivize contractors and home owners to build energy efficient systems for heating in the State of New York.

## Project Outcome

The objective is to identify if the measures taken by the program have been successful in reducing the overall economic costs and reducing energy needs depending upon the performance after the end of the first year after measure implementation. Energy Studies identify and analyze opportunities to make buildings more efficient, which lowers associated energy costs.
